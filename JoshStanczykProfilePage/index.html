            <h2>About Me <br>Josh Stanczyk</h2>
            <p>
                I am a devoted problem solver that leverages technology to find innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career has traced its way through multiple levels of fabrication and manufacturing where I discovered
                that the integration of modern technology to find business solutions in that sector helps businesses become more competitive
                by leveraging readily available information into business insight to make succsesful decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This discovery impacted my decision to return to school and seek more knowledge through academic education.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning new programming languages and technology stacks, and adapting 
                them to real world problems to observe the positive impact of their integration.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I got engaged earlier this year in Tampa Bay and am looking forward to marrying my fiance, and our wedding
                will take place after I graduate next year in May of 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there we will look to purchase our first home and start a family together.
            </p>
