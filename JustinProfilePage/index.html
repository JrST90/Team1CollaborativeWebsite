			<h2> About Me <br> Justin Kisner </h2>
			<p> Hello! My name is Justin and I am 24! Welcome to my "About Me" page!<p>
			
			I am from a rural town in Eighty Four, Pennslyvania. I grow up with a love of the outdoors.
			From hunting and fishing, to playing sports, I try to find time outside as much as possible.
			More recently, deer hunting has been the only time I can get out and disconnect, by myself and just enoying the outdoors.
			I look forward to the season every year and possibly of loosing time to go out haunts me!
			I also have two dogs and two cats! Their names are Bear and Kugo, and JD and KitKat.<p>
			
			I also am learning farsi in my free time. This has been a difficult, but fun way test myself and connect more with my best friend. <p>
			
			Professionally, I am a jewelery salesperson at Macy`s. I have worked there for three years and plan to work there until graduation. 
			Once I graduate, I do not have a "dream job" in mind. I am looking for something I can grow in and find enjoyment doing. 
			I choose CIS to find a steady job in a growing field, it is not my passion, but is an interest that I do enjoy and wish to learn more and more about.
			<p>
